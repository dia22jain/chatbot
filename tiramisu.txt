Certainly! Tiramisu is a classic Italian dessert, and here's a vegetarian-friendly recipe for you:

**Ingredients:**

For the Coffee Soaking Mixture:
- 1 cup strong brewed coffee, cooled
- 2 tablespoons coffee liqueur (optional)
- 2 tablespoons sugar

For the Mascarpone Filling:
- 1 1/2 cups heavy cream
- 1 cup mascarpone cheese
- 1 cup granulated sugar
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract

Additional Ingredients:
- 24-30 ladyfinger cookies (savoiardi)
- Cocoa powder for dusting

**Instructions:**

1. **Prepare the Coffee Soaking Mixture:**
   - In a shallow dish, combine the strong brewed coffee, coffee liqueur (if using), and sugar. Stir until the sugar is dissolved. Set aside.

2. **Prepare the Mascarpone Filling:**
   - In a mixing bowl, whip the heavy cream until stiff peaks form.
   - In another bowl, whisk together mascarpone cheese, granulated sugar, and vanilla extract until smooth.
   - Gently fold the whipped cream into the mascarpone mixture until well combined. Be careful not to deflate the whipped cream.

3. **Assemble the Tiramisu:**
   - Quickly dip each ladyfinger into the coffee mixture, ensuring they are moistened but not overly soaked.
   - Arrange a layer of dipped ladyfingers in the bottom of a serving dish or individual serving glasses.

4. **Add the Mascarpone Layer:**
   - Spread half of the mascarpone filling over the layer of ladyfingers, smoothing it with a spatula.

5. **Repeat Layers:**
   - Repeat the process with another layer of dipped ladyfingers and the remaining mascarpone filling.

6. **Chill:**
   - Cover the tiramisu and refrigerate for at least 4 hours or overnight. Chilling allows the flavors to meld and the dessert to set.

7. **Dust with Cocoa:**
   - Before serving, dust the top of the tiramisu with cocoa powder using a fine sieve.

8. **Serve:**
   - Serve chilled and enjoy your homemade vegetarian tiramisu!
