Certainly! Here's a classic recipe for Bolognese sauce, a rich and hearty meat sauce that goes well with various pasta dishes:

**Ingredients:**

- 1 tablespoon olive oil
- 1 onion, finely chopped
- 2 carrots, peeled and finely chopped
- 2 celery stalks, finely chopped
- 3 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 pound (450g) ground beef (or a mixture of beef and pork)
- 1/2 cup red wine (optional)
- 1 can (28 ounces) crushed tomatoes
- 2 tablespoons tomato paste
- 1 cup beef or vegetable broth
- 1 teaspoon dried oregano
- 1 teaspoon dried basil
- 1/2 teaspoon dried thyme
- Salt and black pepper to taste
- 1 cup whole milk
- 1/2 cup heavy cream (optional)
- Grated Parmesan cheese for serving
- Chopped fresh parsley for garnish
- Cooked pasta of your choice

**Instructions:**

1. **Sauté Vegetables:**
   - Heat olive oil in a large pot over medium heat. Add chopped onions, carrots, and celery. Sauté until the vegetables are softened, about 5-7 minutes.

2. **Cook Ground Meat:**
   - Add minced garlic and ground beef to the pot. Cook, breaking up the meat with a spoon, until browned.

3. **Deglaze with Wine (Optional):**
   - Pour in the red wine and cook for a few minutes, allowing it to reduce and infuse flavor. If you prefer a non-alcoholic version, skip this step.

4. **Add Tomatoes and Broth:**
   - Stir in crushed tomatoes, tomato paste, beef or vegetable broth, oregano, basil, thyme, salt, and black pepper. Bring the mixture to a simmer.

5. **Simmer and Add Dairy:**
   - Reduce the heat to low and let the sauce simmer for at least 1-2 hours, stirring occasionally. The longer it simmers, the more flavorful it will be.
   - About 30 minutes before serving, add the whole milk and heavy cream (if using) to the sauce. Stir well.

6. **Adjust Seasoning and Serve:**
   - Taste and adjust the seasoning as needed. Add more salt and pepper if necessary.
   - Serve the Bolognese sauce over cooked pasta of your choice. Garnish with grated Parmesan cheese and chopped fresh parsley.
