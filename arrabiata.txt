**Person A:** Hey, I've been in the mood for a spicy kick lately. Got a killer recipe for Arrabiata sauce?

**Person B:** Absolutely! Arrabiata is a fantastic choice. Here's a detailed recipe for you:

**Ingredients:**
- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- 4 cloves garlic, minced
- 1/2 teaspoon red pepper flakes (adjust to your spice preference)
- 1 can (28 ounces) crushed tomatoes
- Salt and black pepper, to taste
- 1 teaspoon dried oregano
- 1 teaspoon dried basil
- 1/2 cup fresh basil, chopped
- Your favorite pasta (penne or spaghetti work well)

**Person A:** Awesome! I'm ready to spice things up. What's the first step?

**Person B:** Great! Heat the olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Once it's warm, add the minced garlic and red pepper flakes. Saut√© for about a minute until the garlic becomes fragrant.

**Person A:** Garlic and red pepper flakes, got it. Then what?

**Person B:** Now, add the crushed tomatoes to the skillet. Season with salt, black pepper, dried oregano, and dried basil. Stir everything together and let it simmer for about 15-20 minutes. The sauce should thicken and the flavors meld.

**Person A:** Sounds good. How spicy should it be?

**Person B:** The spice level is up to you. Start with a 1/2 teaspoon of red pepper flakes, and you can adjust from there. If you like it really spicy, add more.

**Person A:** Nice. What's next?

**Person B:** Towards the end of the simmering time, stir in the fresh chopped basil. This adds a burst of freshness to the sauce.

**Person A:** Fresh basil, got it. What's the final step?

**Person B:** Cook your favorite pasta according to the package instructions. Once it's al dente, drain it and toss it directly into the arrabiata sauce. Make sure the pasta is well coated in the spicy goodness.

**Person A:** This sounds amazing. Any finishing touches?

**Person B:** Absolutely! Drizzle a bit more olive oil over the top, and if you like, sprinkle some extra red pepper flakes for that extra kick. A sprinkle of Parmesan cheese is also a great addition.

**Person A:** Perfect! Thanks for sharing. I'm making this for dinner tonight.

**Person B:** Enjoy the spicy goodness! It's a flavorful dish that packs a punch. Let me know how it turns out!
