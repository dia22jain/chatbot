Certainly! Here's a simple recipe for a delicious homemade veggie burger:

**Ingredients:**

For the Veggie Patties:
- 2 cups cooked black beans (canned, drained, and rinsed)
- 1 cup breadcrumbs
- 1/2 cup finely chopped onions
- 1/2 cup grated carrots
- 1/2 cup finely chopped bell peppers (any color)
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 teaspoon ground cumin
- 1 teaspoon paprika
- 1/2 teaspoon dried oregano
- Salt and pepper to taste
- 1 egg (or a flax egg for a vegan option)
- Olive oil for cooking

For Assembling the Burger:
- Burger buns
- Lettuce leaves
- Sliced tomatoes
- Sliced onions
- Pickles
- Cheese slices (optional)
- Ketchup, mustard, mayonnaise (or your preferred condiments)

**Instructions:**

1. In a large bowl, mash the black beans with a fork or potato masher until mostly smooth, leaving some chunks for texture.

2. Add breadcrumbs, chopped onions, grated carrots, chopped bell peppers, minced garlic, ground cumin, paprika, dried oregano, salt, and pepper to the mashed black beans. Mix well.

3. Add the egg (or flax egg) to the mixture and combine until everything holds together. If the mixture is too wet, add more breadcrumbs.

4. Divide the mixture into equal portions and shape them into patties.

5. Heat olive oil in a skillet over medium heat. Cook the veggie patties for 4-5 minutes on each side or until they are golden brown and cooked through.

6. Toast the burger buns in the same skillet or in a toaster.

7. Assemble your veggie burger by placing a veggie patty on the bottom half of the bun. Top it with lettuce, sliced tomatoes, onions, pickles, and cheese if desired.

8. Spread your favorite condiments on the top half of the bun, and then place it on top of the assembled ingredients.

9. Serve your veggie burger with a side of sweet potato fries, regular fries, or a simple salad.
