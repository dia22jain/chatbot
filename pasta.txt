There are numerous types of pasta, each with its own shape, texture, and ideal pairing with specific sauces. Here's a list of some popular types of pasta:

1. **Spaghetti:**
   - Long, thin, cylindrical pasta. Commonly served with tomato-based sauces, meat sauces, or seafood.

2. **Fettuccine:**
   - Wide, flat pasta noodles. Often used with Alfredo sauce, creamy sauces, or hearty meat sauces.

3. **Linguine:**
   - Similar to spaghetti but wider and flatter. Works well with seafood and lighter sauces.

4. **Penne:**
   - Short, tube-like pasta with diagonally cut ends. Excellent with thick sauces, like marinara or Bolognese.

5. **Rigatoni:**
   - Large, ridged tubes. The ridges help trap sauces, making it great for hearty meat or vegetable sauces.

6. **Farfalle (Bowtie):**
   - Shaped like bowties or butterflies. Pairs well with light sauces, vegetables, or in cold pasta salads.

7. **Rotini:**
   - Corkscrew-shaped pasta. Ideal for holding chunky sauces, as the spirals trap the sauce effectively.

8. **Orzo:**
   - Small, rice-shaped pasta. Often used in soups or as a base for pasta salads.

9. **Pappardelle:**
   - Long, broad ribbons. Suitable for hearty meat sauces, especially those with slow-cooked meats.

10. **Orecchiette:**
    - Small, ear-shaped pasta. Commonly paired with broccoli rabe, sausage, or other chunky sauces.

11. **Cavatelli:**
    - Small pasta shells with a rolled edge. Good with chunky sauces, as they catch and hold the sauce.

12. **Conchiglie (Shells):**
    - Shell-shaped pasta. Works well with thick sauces and in baked dishes.

13. **Tagliatelle:**
    - Long, flat ribbons similar to fettuccine but narrower. Pairs well with creamy sauces or Bolognese.

14. **Gnocchi:**
    - Soft dumplings made from potatoes, flour, and sometimes eggs. Served with various sauces, such as pesto or brown butter.

15. **Ravioli:**
    - Small pasta pockets filled with various ingredients like cheese, meat, or vegetables. Often served with a sauce.

16. **Tortellini:**
    - Small, ring-shaped pasta stuffed with meat, cheese, or vegetables. Typically served in soups or with a light sauce.

17. **Cappelletti:**
    - Similar to tortellini but larger. Often served in broth or with a light sauce.

18. **Lumaconi:**
    - Large snail-shaped pasta. Good for stuffing or serving with chunky sauces.

These are just a few examples, and there are many more pasta shapes and varieties, each contributing to the diversity of Italian cuisine. The choice of pasta can significantly impact the overall dish, as different shapes hold sauces in distinctive ways.
