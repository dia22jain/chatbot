**Person B:** Absolutely! Pesto is a classic and so versatile. Here's a detailed recipe for you:

**Ingredients:**
- 2 cups fresh basil leaves, packed

**Person A:** Fantastic! I love the freshness of pesto. What's the first step?

**Person B:** Great choice! Start by toasting the pine nuts in a dry skillet over medium heat until they're lightly golden and fragrant. Be sure to keep an eye on them; they can burn quickly.

**Person A:** Got it, toasting the pine nuts. Then what?

**Person B:** In a food processor, combine the fresh basil, grated Parmesan, toasted pine nuts, and garlic cloves. Pulse until everything is finely chopped.

**Person A:** Sounds simple enough. What's next?

**Person B:** With the food processor running, slowly drizzle in the olive oil until the mixture becomes a smooth paste. Season with salt and pepper to taste.

**Person A:** Olive oil, salt, and pepper, got it. What's the next step?

**Person B:** If you like an extra kick, add grated Pecorino Romano cheese. Pulse a few more times to combine. Taste and adjust the seasoning if needed.

**Person A:** Pecorino Romano, got it. What's the final step?

**Person B:** Cook your favorite pasta according to the package instructions. Once it's cooked, drain it and toss it with the freshly made pesto. Make sure the pasta is well-coated.

**Person A:** This sounds delicious. Any finishing touches?

**Person B:** Absolutely! Drizzle a bit of extra-virgin olive oil over the top, and you can sprinkle some additional Parmesan or pine nuts if you like. A few extra fresh basil leaves make a nice garnish.

**Person A:** Perfect! Thanks for sharing. I'm making this for dinner tonight.
